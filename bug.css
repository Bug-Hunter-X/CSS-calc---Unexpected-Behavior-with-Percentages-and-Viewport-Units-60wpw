The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results when used with percentages and viewport units (vw, vh).  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10vw);` might not behave as expected if the viewport width changes.  The calculation is performed only once, when the element is rendered, and it doesn't automatically recalculate when the viewport size changes. This can lead to elements overflowing their containers or unexpected spacing issues.
